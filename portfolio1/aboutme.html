        After serving 8 years in the United States Army as an Infantryman I felt it was time to chase my dream career,
        Software Engineering. I left the Army with an Honorable discharge in August 2021 and started my journey in coding. <br> <br>
        With high motivation and dicipline I adapted from the Army it took only 1 month to start my own projects 
        then another 4 months before I felt comfortable enough to start freelancing for expierence. Within the next year I will also be graduating from 
        College of San Mateo with an Associates in Computer Science. <br><br>
        Im currently living in my hometown Brentwood California, helping local buisnesses make their 
        mark on the internet by building their own custom webites. <br><br>
